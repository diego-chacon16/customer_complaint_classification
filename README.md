#### Purpose:

+ A seamless and great customer experience is one of the most important pillars in a successful business today

+ That being said, there are ways in which Machine Learning can be applied, saving money and resources


#### Tasks:

+ Begin by filtering the dataset to only the consumer complaints and the product
+ Remove any consumer complaints with null values
+ Create a visual to show a breakdown of the different products and its overall volume in the consumer complaint category
+ Clean the text and remove unnecessary characters
+ Split the dataset into train, test and validation
